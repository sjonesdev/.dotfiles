# .dotfiles
My dotfiles managed with GNU Stow. Currently only setup for arch linux.

### Todo
- Upload to github
- fix monitor
- rice hyprland
- rice kitty
- figure out zellij

### Tips to remember
- Can use `.stow-local-ignore` to set patterns to ignore in packages, but this completely overrides the default stow ignore file
